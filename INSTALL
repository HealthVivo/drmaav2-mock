drmaa2-mock was implemented and tested on Mac OS 10.8 with gcc 4.2.


Dependencies:
	unix process handling and synchronization (fork, semaphores)
	sqlite3 (for persistency handling)
	CUnit for testing

---------------------------------------

To build drmaa2-mock run:

./configure
make

./drmaa2-reset-db	can be used to setup and reset the (current) drmaa2 database (required for the sample application).
./example-large		starts a sample application (using the current set database). It's source code can be found in examples/large.c. (NOTE: "example-large" requires a preceding call of ./drmaa2-reset-db)

The environment variable DRMAA2_DB_NAME stores the current used drmaa2 database. If DRMAA2_DB_NAME is not set, the default database of drmaa2-mock "drmaa2.sqlite" is used.
The current database can be changed with:
export DRMAA2_DB_NAME=...

---------------------------------------

To build and run the drmaa2-mock tests suite:
(The test suite uses its own database "drmaa2_test.sqite".)

make tests
./test/test
