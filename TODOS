- split up implementation in multiple files

- improve testsystem (execution of single tests)

- prefix global variables

- use test database (implementation should allow multiple databases)




- reservation interface: terminate reservation

- complete jobinfo filter

- notifications

- introspection

- jobarray support

- job categories

- machine info



- slot info





questions:

(- naming of implementation specific functions)

- which job categories?
	openmp

- j/rsession destroy semantic

- free slotinfo (unnecessary?)



- reservation request (only name and id are set)
