Welcome !
=========

This is the reference implementation of the DRMAAv2 C language binding.
It is maintained by members of the Open Grid Forum (OGF) standardization
group working on the 'Distributed Resource Management Application API (DRMAA)'. 

If you don't know what DRMAA is, please consult http://www.drmaa.org.

The intention of this code base is to have a starting point for true product implementations
of the DRMAAv2 C language binding. The source code licence is 'newBSD', which allows the unrestricted usage
in both closed source and open source projects.

We would be happy if you give us a hint if this code was helpful for you.
Additions to the test suite and forks are also more than welcome.
